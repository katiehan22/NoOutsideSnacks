# No Outside Snacks

Play the game [here](https://katiehan22.github.io/NoOutsideSnacks/)!

## Background
No Outside Snacks is a movie theater concession stand themed game. Food orders will move across the bottom of the screen. The player must match the correct topping with the food item to earn enough points to move on to the next level. The player advances through 4 levels with the levels progressively get harder as the food items move faster and the orders get larger. 

## Functionality and MVPs
Players are able to: 
* Control which topping dispenser use by hovering with the mouse.
* Dispense the topping onto the food item with a click. The food image will change to indicate whether or not the player was correcrt and earned a point. 
* Keep track of their score and earn enough points to advance through the 4 levels.

Additional Features:
* Music: Background music and sound effects based on different actions, with a mute button.
