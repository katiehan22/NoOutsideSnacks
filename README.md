# No Outside Snacks

## Background
No Outside Snacks is a movie theater concession stand themed game. There will be 4 dispensers - movie theater butter, slushee, nacho cheese, and pretzel salt. Trays of food will move across the bottom of the screen. The user must match the correct topping with the food item and get enough points to move on to the next level. The levels with progressively get harder with the food items moving faster and the orders getting larger. 

## Functionality and MVPs
Players will be able to: 
* Control which food dispenser use by hovering with the mouse.
* Dispense the topping onto the food item with a click.
* Keep track of their score and earn enough points to move onto the next level.

Additional Features:
* Music: Background music and sound effects based on different actions.
